# 1978 R2D2 Replacement Parts

## The Backstory

It is common for some of the plastic gears in the 1978 remote controlled R2D2s to crack. In order to fix these R2 units, I replaced the cracked gears with ones I 3D designed and printed. I would like to share these designs to assist any potential reparing processes of other R2 units.

## Something to Note

These designs were reversed engineered by measuring the dimensions of the broken gears with calibers and are, therefore, not identical copies of the originals. However, I have found that they work very well when printed properly and with the correct material.

## 3D Printing Pointers

Printing the designs very slowly on a raft with ABS seems to yield quality gears that are more robust than the originals.

## Final Words

The Autodesk Fusion 360 designs and the exported STL files are only included since the G-code to 3D print the parts should be adjusted to optimize the print quality with respect to your available 3D printer.
